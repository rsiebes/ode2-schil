Tools and scripts to convert open data to RDF for the Open Data Exchange II project

<b> INSTALLATION </b>

The scripts are made for <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js </a>, so you need to install that in order to execute them.
Also you will need to install some node.js packages, like the <a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb#basic-querying">NEBDB</a> file-based datastore by typing (after having installed node.js):

npm install nedb --save
